## 🧑‍💻 About Me

I'm Omid, a Junior Fullstack Developer focused on PHP and the Laravel framework. My two-year training as an application developer (IHK) gave me a strong foundation in programming, database development, and agile project work.

During my 7-month internship, I built internal production applications with Laravel. I wrote unit tests to analyze codebases, track down bugs, and understand projects deeply. On the frontend, I developed dynamic interfaces using Vue.js and RESTful APIs. I also handled IT support and onboarded new colleagues with hardware and software.

I thrive working in teams, but I'm also independent and responsible. I love to learn, grow, and explore new experiences every day!
