## 🧑‍💻 About Me

I'm Omid, a Junior Fullstack Developer focused on PHP and the Laravel framework. My two-year training as an application developer (IHK) gave me a strong foundation in programming, database development, and agile project work.

I thrive working in teams, but I'm also independent and responsible. I love to learn, grow, and explore new experiences every day!
